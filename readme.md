## LSTM sentiment analysis predictor

This repository contains a LSTM architecture for the prediction of sentiment of short texts (for example tweets). I am using it for predicting sentiment of texts in spanish language. 

I store the data in a mongo db database, but, the model takes a tsv file as input with the format: sentence \t label.
